# Example overrides for a dev environment, assuming you pull `ojs.compose.yaml`
# and `db.compose.yml` into your main compose file. This shows how your web
# environment might look in development.
#
# For a production setup, you will definitely not use this as-is. Some
# examples of what might change:
#
# - You might use an external database, so you'd have to specify the production
#   database env vars here and remove the "db" service
# - You should set HTTPS to "on" (and only allow secure traffic to the
#   container)
# - You really don't want a dependency on the smtpdebug service.
